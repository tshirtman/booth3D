Kivy-Particle was originally written by Alexis Couronne and greatly inspired by [Starling Extension Particle System](https://github.com/PrimaryFeather/Starling-Extension-Particle-System). Chaos Buffalo Labs has produced this cythonized version of the code and rewritten the rendering to correctly reflect the implementation in Starling.
